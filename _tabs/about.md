## Skydiving
----

One of my favorite activities is skydiving. I have been skydiving
since 2017 and have over 650 jumps. I got into the sport the summer
after I graduated high school. I went to a local dropzone with my
father and friends and was hooked. I have been skydiving ever since.

## Music
----

I have been playing music since I was a kid in elementary school.
I play the guitar, drums, trumpet, and french horn. I graduated from
high school with an Associate of Arts degree in Music and studied
Music Composition at Pacific Lutheran University which is based near
Tacoma, Washington. I have been writing music as a hobby for many
years and still actively play the guitar.
