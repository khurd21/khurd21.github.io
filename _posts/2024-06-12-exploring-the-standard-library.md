During a talk at work, I decided to present some common scenarios I saw
during code reviews and show some cool C++ library feature alternatives!

Some of the items discussed were:

- [std::any](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/any)
- [std::remove_if](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/remove)
- [std::erase](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/erase2)
- [std::transform](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/transform)
- [std::accumulate](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/accumulate)
- [std::for_each](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/for_each)
- [std::exchange](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/exchange)
- [std::clamp](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/clamp)
- [std::all_of](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/all_any_none_of)
