Greetings, world! This is my first post on my new blog.
I'm excited to get started. This post is a test to ensure that
everything is working properly. I'll be posting more soon. In the
mean time, here's a few pictures of my cat, Max. He is an adorable
kitty and I try to spoil him every chance I get. He currently lives
with my parents as I am away at college, but I visit him during
my breaks from school.
